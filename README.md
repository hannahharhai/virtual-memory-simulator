# virtual-memory-simulator
Virtual Memory Simulator with various paging algorithms using a two-level paging scheme.

Implemented a two-level page table to simulate the process of paging and virtual memory management. The implementation includes the optimal (opt) algorithm as a baseline, the least recently used (LRU), and the second chance clock algorithms. At the end of simulation, a series of stats are printed out to be able to compare/analyze each of the algorithms and their effectiveness.
